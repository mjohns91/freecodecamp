            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
            <h3>So what is HTML?</h3>
            <p>HTML is a <i>markup language</i> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
            <code class="code-example">My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
            <code class="code-example">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png">
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>The opening tag</b>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li><b>The closing tag</b>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                <li><b>The content</b>: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <li><b>The element</b>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute <i>name</i> and editor-note is the attribute <i>value</i>. The <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style information and other things.</p>
            <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="images">
            <header>Images</header>
            <p>Let's turn our attention to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element again:</p>
            <code class="code-example">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
            <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the <code>src</code> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
            <p>We have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
                <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your <code>src</code> attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png">
            <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>
            <p>Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="marking_up_text">
            <header>Marking up text</header>
            <p>This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
            <h3>Headings</h3>
            <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
            <code class="code-example">
                --4 heading levels--
            </code>
            <p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</p>
            <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="links">
            <header>Links</header>
            <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="conclusion">
            <header>Conclusion</header>
            <p>If you have followed all the instructions in this article, you should end up with a page that looks like the one below (you can also <a href="https://mdn.github.io/beginner-html-site/">view it here</a>):</p>
